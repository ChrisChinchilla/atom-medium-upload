# Medium Upload

Write your Medium stories in Atom like a hacker and upload them to directly Medium as a draft or a public story.

On your first time toggling this package, you will be sent to login to Medium and authorize this package as an application. From then on in, your tokens will be stored in the config file (DO NOT SHARE THESE!). When the token expires, the package automatically fetches a new one, so don't worry about authentication after your first go.

The package currently looks for file names with the `.md` extension, and uses the file name as the post title.

ex. filename 'My-Post.md' story title 'My Post'
